# Styx Emulator

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/styx-emulator/styx-emulator.svg)](https://github.com/styx-emulator/styx-emulator/blob/main/LICENSE)

The Styx Emulator is a composable emulation framework with the primary goal
of rapid emulator development for debugging target systems. The Styx Emulator
is primarily a Rust library with bindings in multiple languages and
extensions for multiple tools.

Styx is under active development and does not currently follow Semantic Versioning. Beware of breaking changes!

This is a monorepo that contains code for the `styx-core` library, its
pre-packaged components in the `styx-emulator` library, and the extensions built
on top of it under `extensions` and `incubation`. Styx also ships with a builtin
`tracebus` packaged in the `styx-tracebus` crate.

When talking about "the Styx Emulator", we're generally talking about
the `styx-emulator` library, which contains all the in-tree processors, peripherals,
devices, machines, and cpu's etc. When discussing extensions, we usually
refer to them by name.

## Development Environment

You have a few choices, none of which are too complicated

### devcontainer

Opening the repository in VSCode should prompt you to build + use the devcontainer,
it should "just work".

For more information on development within a pre-configured development container, see
the "Remote Development Containers" section in [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### guix

After installing `direnv`, the proper shell hooks, and adding the repo to the allowed `direnv` paths, simply run:

``` bash
enter-guix
```

### Docker container based

You can pull the `docker` container used for devcontainers + CI from
`ghcr.io/styx-emulator/styx-emulator/styx-ci:main`, or you could build
build the `docker` container yourself at `./utils/docker/ci.Dockerfile`.

``` bash
# NOTE: the build context should be the root of the styx-emulator working directory
#       (the trailing `.`)
docker build -t styx-ci -f ./utils/docker/ci.Dockerfile --build-arg RUST_VERSION=$(cat .rust-version) .
```

### Host / Native development

To perform host development, you'll need somewhat recent versions of the following tools:
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
- A working rust installation (cargo will automatically install the correct versions)
- `python` > 3.9 + `python3-virtualenv` + `python3-pip`
- [protobuf-compiler](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) >= 21.5
- `cmake`

#### For Tests + Local CI
- `pre-commit`
- `gdb-multiarch` (`gdb` on RHEL systems)

### Project Setup

Make sure rust is installed with at least the following components:

```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview --toolchain stable
rustup component add rust-analyzer --toolchain stable
```

then install just and run the setup task

```bash
cargo install just && just setup
```

This will install a virtualenv at `./venv`. This will also install the `cargo`
tools needed for `CI`, linting and testing. (See [justfile](./justfile)).

## Documentation

After completing the setup steps, run the following to build the docs (these are hosted on git pages)

```bash
just docs
```

To build the Rust API docs (not hosted on git pages), run

```bash
just rust-docs
```
