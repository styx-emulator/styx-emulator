## Dependencies

To build FreeRTOS for the target you need to have the powerpc GNU toolchain i.e. `powerpc-eabi-gcc`.  This can be acquired from the [Xilinx EDK](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/archive-ise.html).  The Dockerfile expects a file named `tools.tar.gz`, which contains the powerpc GNU toolchain and its dependencies.  The Dockerfile unpacks the tools and places them on the path.

The makefile for building FreeRTOS expects the following environment variables to be set:

- `RTOS_DIR`: the path to the FreeRTOS source
- `XILINX_DIR`: the path to the files generated by the Xilinx EDK

## Sources

- `src/ppc405_0` contains generated files from the Xilinx EDK version 10.1
- The FreeRTOS source files are cloned from their git repo at tag `V8.2.3`, commit hash `64fd771d68daaf7507bbe42bc2abfe6bd74c5ec0`
