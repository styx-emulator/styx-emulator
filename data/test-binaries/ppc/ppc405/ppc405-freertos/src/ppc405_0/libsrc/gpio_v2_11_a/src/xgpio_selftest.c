* in which the data register is read. It only does a read without any kind
* of test because the hardware has been parameterized such that it may be only

*
* All other hardware features of the device are not guaranteed to be in the

*		This parameter must have been previously initialized with
*		XGpio_Initialize().
*
* @return 	XST_SUCCESS always. If the GPIO device was not present in the

*		bus error, such as registers in bridges or buses, may be
*		necessary to determine if this function caused a bus error.
