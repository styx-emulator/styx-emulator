Overview
========

This document explains the freertos_generic example. It is based on code FreeRTOS documentation from
http://www.freertos.org/Hardware-independent-RTOS-example.html. It shows combination of several
tasks with queue, software timer, tick hook and semaphore.

The example application creates three tasks. The prvQueueSendTask periodically sending data to
xQueue queue. The prvQueueReceiveTask is waiting for incoming message and counting number of
received messages. Task prvEventSemaphoreTask is waiting for xEventSemaphore semaphore given from
vApplicationTickHook. Tick hook give semaphore every 500 ms.

Other hook types used for RTOS and resource statistics are also demonstrated in example:
* vApplicationIdleHook
* vApplicationStackOverflowHook
* vApplicationMallocFailedHook



Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.3
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 6-2017-q2
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- TWR-K21F120M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.
Prepare the Demo
================

Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will start periodically printing the state of generic example.

Example output:
Event task is running.
Receive message counter: 1.
