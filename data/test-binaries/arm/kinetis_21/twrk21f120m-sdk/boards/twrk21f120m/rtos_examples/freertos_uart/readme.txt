Overview
========
The UART example for FreeRTOS demonstrates the possibility to use the UART driver in the RTOS.
The example uses single instance of UART IP and writes string into, then reads back chars.
After every 4B received, these are sent back on UART.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.11.3
- Keil MDK 5.23
- GCC ARM Embedded 6-2017-q2
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.2.0
- MCUXpresso10.1.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- TWR-K21F120M board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
You will see the welcome string printed out on the console.
You can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console in a group of 4 characters.
