The SLASPEC relies a lot on Java helpers, [https://github.com/toshipiazza/ghidra-plugin-hexagon/tree/be29246fc234ece766a5719564bb55ccf69bc1e7/Ghidra/Processors/Hexagon/src/main/java/ghidra/app/plugin/core/analysis](found in the directory here), specifically in directory `Ghidra/Processors/Hexagon/src/main/java/ghidra/app/plugin/core/analysis`. The link uses the commit hash that was referenced above.

These Java helpers were used to help implement Hexagon support in Styx.
